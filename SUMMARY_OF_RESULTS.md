# *SUMMARY OF RESULTS:*<br />

1) After several analysis of Bird Eye View we can see in the LiDAR point clouds that you will find several vehicles in the road:

2) The intensity map in a conversion of Bird Eye View to (X,Y) image in order to use it to detect, for example: vehicles:

3) Taking advantage of the BEV we can analyze the intesity of the LiDAR beam/beams collision in order to improve the object detection:
